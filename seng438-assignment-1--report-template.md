# Introduction

Before we began this lab, we knew that exploratory testing was testing the application without any structured plan,
but required a deep knowledge of the requirements for the application; Manual functional testing, on the other hand,
was similar to exploratory testing but follows an actual structured plan with test suites and does not require a deep knowledge
of the requirements.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our group's plan for exploratory testing was to split into pairs, but each individual did their own exploratory testing, which all consisted of using the ATM as intended based on the requirements provided and making a bug report if anything unusual or unexpected occured.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

In exploratory testing, we first familiarized ourselves with the ATM requirements and the artifacts that were given to us and just used the system as intended to see if anything unsual or broken appears before us. In manual functional testing, we would simply follow the test suite that was provided in the lab document and testing each case without worrying about the requirements. Manual functional testing was more thorough while exploratory testing found more unexpected or unpredictable bugs.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

We split into pairs for the exploratory testing. Ryan paired up with Mathew, Jonas paired up with Mason. After each pairs exploratory testing, the group get together and
combined our results while working on the munal scripted testing and regressions testing. We all looked over each other's defect reports to ensure they were adequete and
consistent. 

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Each individual did there own exploratory testing and added bugs they found to the backlog. Manual scripted testing and regression testing were done as a group. Each group member were given 10 scripted test cases to test and those same 10 test cases were also tested through regression testing by each member. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

There were no major difficulties or challenges during this lab. The only minor challenge was that of organizing our group to meet. We did learn about using the Backlog website as a tool to report bugs and putting exploratory, manual scripting, and regression testing into practice.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The lab document was thorough and explained the actual lab very well. Images were very useful as it directly shows what page to be looking at during certain steps. Good explanation of how to use backlog and going through each step as just saying to use backlog without the explanation would have been frustrating and tedious.  Was having a little trouble finding where Appendix A, B and C were so having a section for those would be great. The actual lab was useful as doing the testing allowed us to really learn the process of each type of testing.
